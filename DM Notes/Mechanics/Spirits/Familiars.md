#Mechanic 

Familiars are not like pets as they are made out of pure [[Soul]]. They do not have an actual body, the soul is given form in the familiar and the player who has bonded with the familiar. The player will have to give up temporary health to summon their familiar. Except if they use some sort of other way to materialise the familiar, i.e. orbs of soul energy.
