#Mechanic

There is no magic in this world. Everything from spellslots to magical items depends on life force. Magically enchanted items have been imbued with the lifeforce of an entity. Magical weapons house the soul of the crafter, the ones slain by the blade or a part of the soul that the enchanter put in there. Because of this, magical weapons are exceedingly rare, difficult to make and treasured. All nations have some weapons that are treasured not for their monetary value but because of the soul that is housed inside. Whenever someone goes to the [[Spirit plane]], the item reverts to the originator of the soul.
