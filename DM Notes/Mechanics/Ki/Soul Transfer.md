The process of soul transfer is different to adding a bit of the soul. Here the one who has got his soul transferred perishes from the body.

This will enhance the power of the object but also living souls. 





It is possible for those who live in the [[Spirit plane]] to take over te body of those in the [[material plane]]. This enhances the body in offensive capabilites, but the body will hurt due to not being used due to the magical potential.
