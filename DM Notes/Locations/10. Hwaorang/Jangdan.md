1.  Jangdan (장단) - Jangdan is a term used in Korean traditional music to describe rhythmic patterns that are repeated throughout a piece.


[[Jangdan]] is located on the [[Heartbeat Harbor]]. It would be the second most important port of the [[Northern korean region]]. It is located between 2 canals. To the north, there is a bridge to cross to the other side. In the south, no bridge is provided. On the other side, there is the city of [[Cheongsim]]. This is because it is the border between the [[Northern korean region]] and [[Southern korean region]]. While tensions aren't always high, there is a big difference between the two nations. Most of the shady things happened by an organisation that handled in trade between the two sides.
