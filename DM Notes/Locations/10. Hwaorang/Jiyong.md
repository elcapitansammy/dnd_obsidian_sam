#Location #Hwaorang #City

The Korean capital is centered to the West of the [[Hwaorang]]. It is not a port town itself but it is not far from it. The capital mixes in different cultures, not only Korean, but also Japanese and Chinese as they are all part of one whole. 

The [[Jiyong university]] has a campus atop a hill in the East.
