#Item #VrikshaRajya 

This will be found at [[Chandrakona]] at the top of the cliff. It looks as if the water falls into the sea, but it is actually divided by rock formation. This is where most people will go to get fresh water.

The fountain looks like the sikh symbol of the Khanda, Chakram and two Kirpans.
