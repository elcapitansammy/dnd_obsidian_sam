Explain the [[Practical Rules]] and [[Modified rules]]




### Preparing to prepare

genre: Fantasy focused around different ethnicities without the influence of traditional colonialism

Game system: Dnd with homebrew to make some moments matter more

Scenario: Explore the world while uncovering your own mysteries

Power Level: We start at level 3

Expected length of game: multiple years, however if life puts you on another track, there's no problem as long as we can discuss what we can do to finish up your story.

#### Step 1: Establish Genre and Tone

##### Genre

*What is your favorite aspect of the game we chose?*
*What is your favorite aspect of the setting?*
*What would you like to see in this game based on our genre?*
*What did you find less interesting?*

##### Violence
*Based on our discussion of genre, what is the role of violence in our story?*
	*Is it simply a way to frame action scenes?*
	*Do characters emotionally react to violence perpetrated by themselves or others?*
*How much do we want to explore specific actions in combat?*
	*Will player go into detail beyond "I punch" or "I slash" or should the DM describe it?*
	*Are we okay hearing about blood, injury, and gore?*
*How realistic do we want to be with the violence we depict?*
	*Are we prepared to see tragedy resulting from violent action?*
	*Will PCs fear or use violece?*
	*Is there moral judgement placed on violence?*

##### Gender, Romance and Sexuality
*Romance, yes or no?*
Personally I'm not that into it, but what do you think?

##### Comedy and Drama

*How seriously are we taking this game? What is our attitude regarding its events?*
	*Is this an artistic and personal story?*
	*Are we comfortable with emotional exploration?*
	*Will we treat certain aspects like a competition?*
*When can/should we joke at the table?*
	*In or out of character whenever we want?*
	*In character as long as it fits the scene?*
	*Only after we have resolved dramatic moments?*
*What sort of drama and humor are we comfortable with?*
	*Are there any subjects that should be off-limits?*
	*Are we comfortable exploring real-world subjects through fantasy?*
	*What do we do if our game crosses the line for someone?*



#### Step 3: Define your characters

Assign goals to yourselves. These are small, medium and large AKA immediate (short term), passively working towards and life goal.

Aside from that I would like you to think of your own "information", try to scale them similary as small, medium and big information. Where small info you would say share quite fast and big info should only when the time is perfect or you trust the other PC's.

##### Relationships
*What do you want to know about your PC partner? Here are some questions.*
