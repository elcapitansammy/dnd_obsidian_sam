#NPC 

[[Yoona]] is a childhood friend turned lover of [[Jong-min Bul]]. Eventually, they would break up due to [[Jong-min Bul]] bad communication skills. There was an incident where they had a huge fight. [[Yoona]] told him to give her some space, but he interpreted it as "we're breaking up". Due to this, the next time [[Yoona]] saw him, she scolded him hard and told him "I will never forget this, this memory will wrap around my finger like a red thread!"

(Sorry for the trauma, Sam)



[[Yoona]] also went to the [[Jiyong university]]
