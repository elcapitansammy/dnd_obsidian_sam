### QUESTIONS
Who wanted to get him killed?

### Quotes

whenever [[Sam's character]] messes up and gets scolded by his parents:
_Takes out his map_ 
"You know, whenever I feel like I messed up and Omma and Appa scold me, I like to sit by myself with my map. I try to find the exact position where I would be on this map." _Puts his finger on the map_ "You see? My little mistake doesn't mean that much anymore when I look at how vast this world is. The waves will not stop crashing, because you did your homework wrong. The sea wouldn't be less worthy of exploration, because you broke up with [[Yoona]]" _Chuckles_ "You will be alright little brother, the tides will turn in your favor."

Whenever [[Sam's character]] feels inferior to his brother:
"There is a saying that the sailors teach the rookies on their first day on a long travel. Whenever you see a big wave, that is not what kills men. It is the smaller wave that comes after it. Be that smaller wave, suprise the whole world with what you got."
