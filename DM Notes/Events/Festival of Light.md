#Event #VrikshaRajya 
The festival of Light is a festival that takes place shortly after the [[Festival of color]]. During this time, people make a huge campfire, use their lighting magic like Fairy Lights and Burning Hands, in a way which isn't destructive. Afterwards they dance around as if with the flames. 

Small [Fire Elementals] jump around with the flames. 



It happens on the 28th of [[The Moon of the Tree]].
