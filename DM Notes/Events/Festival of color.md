#Event #VrikshaRajya

The festival of color is celebrated throughout the whole of [[Vriksha Rajya]]. It is a day when the [[Vrikshiya]], citizens of the country, throw around colored powder and make a general 'mess' of things.

### Main Competition
two groups compete where the goal is to eliminate a chosen "king". The king gets some kind of bonuses.

It happens on the first day of [[The Moon of the Tree]].
